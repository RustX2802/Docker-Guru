## Web Application
This section provides a hands-on experience of containerization by guiding you through the creation of a three-tier web application. The application, which includes a React front-end client, two APIs (Node.js and Golang), and a database, is as straightforward as possible while still offering a realistic microservice system to containerize.
  
## Building Container Images
This part illustrates the process of writing Dockerfiles and building container images for the components of the sample web app. We start with a basic implementation and gradually refine it until we have a container image ready for production.

## Container Registries
This section elucidates the concept of container registries and demonstrates how they can be used to share and distribute container images.

## Running Containers
Leveraging the containerized web application from Web Application and Building Container Images sections, we formulate the necessary commands to execute our application using Docker and Docker Compose. We also cover a range of runtime configuration options and the appropriate scenarios for their use.

## Development Workflows
This section establishes the tools and configurations necessary to enhance the developer experience when working with containers.

## Deploying Containers
This final section demonstrates how to deploy container applications to production using a single node Docker Swarm method.
